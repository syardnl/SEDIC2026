## 📌 Overview

Project Guardian is a real-time Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) system for detecting and classifying vessels from image and video inputs. Built for SEDIC 2026 Visual Track, the system uses a fine-tuned **YOLOv8s** model trained via transfer learning on a merged open-source maritime dataset.

The final model (`run_clean_dedup_v1 / best.pt`) achieves a pooled military-class recall of **79.8%** on a corrected, leak-free validation set of 797 images and 2,645 instances.

## 📊 Rubric Summary

| Criterion | Max | Target | Our Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory Classification | 30 | Civilian, Small Craft, Military — multi-angle | ✅ Met |
| Performance Benchmark | 25 | > 80% recall on military/threat classes | 79.8% — 0.2 pts short |
| Competitive Advantage | 10 | Local (Malaysian) vs. foreign military distinction | ⚠️ Partial |
| Technical Brief | 20 | Dataset, architecture, classification logic | ✅ Complete |
| Video Demonstration | 15 | Max 5-min, YouTube | See checklist |

## 🎯 Detection Classes

| Category | Classes | Threat Level |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Civilian | `container_ship`, `tanker`, `cargo`, `passenger_ferry` | CIVILIAN |
| 🟡 Small Craft | `yacht`, `speedboat`, `fishing_boat` | SMALL CRAFT |
| 🟠 Monitor | `patrol_boat` | MONITOR *(supplementary)* |
| 🟠 Military (Local) | `local_military_ship` | PRIORITY |
| 🔴 Military (Foreign) | `foreign_military_ship` | HIGH PRIORITY |

> **Note:** `patrol_boat` is treated as a supplementary category (non-Malaysian stock imagery) and is excluded from the Performance Benchmark calculation.

## 📈 Performance Results

### Military Class Recall (Primary Benchmark)

| Class | Precision | Recall | mAP50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `foreign_military_ship` | 0.896 | **0.934** | 0.952 |
| `local_military_ship` | 0.728 | **0.663** | 0.716 |
| `patrol_boat` *(supplementary)* | 0.523 | 0.538 | 0.599 |
| **Pooled Military Recall** | — | **79.8%** | — |

### Full Per-Class Results

| Class | Precision | Recall | mAP50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `container_ship` | 0.906 | 0.908 | 0.942 |
| `tanker` | 0.921 | 0.840 | 0.899 |
| `cargo` | 0.753 | 0.759 | 0.812 |
| `passenger_ferry` | 0.851 | 0.860 | 0.901 |
| `yacht` | 0.781 | 0.761 | 0.853 |
| `speedboat` | 0.639 | 0.433 | 0.490 |
| `fishing_boat` | 0.792 | 0.558 | 0.680 |
| `tugboat` | 0.620 | 0.459 | 0.535 |

> ⚠️ An earlier figure of **88.7%** was computed on a validation set later found to be **54% contaminated** with training-set duplicates. The corrected figure of 79.8% is the trustworthy result.

## 🔍 Root Cause of the Performance Gap

`foreign_military_ship` recall (93.4%) comfortably exceeds the 80% benchmark on its own. The pooled figure is held below threshold specifically by `local_military_ship` (66.3%), due to two identified causes:

### 1. Data Scarcity — KD Maharaja Lela
A newly delivered RMN frigate with only **2 unique source photographs** in the entire dataset. Live testing confirmed zero detections of this vessel at any confidence threshold — a data-driven blind spot, not a model architecture issue.

### 2. Crowded Multi-Vessel Scene Detection Loss
Images containing multiple RMN vessels in close proximity show partial detection loss. This is a known limitation of single-stage detectors on densely packed small objects, confirmed via dataset instance-count checks and GUI testing.

**Assessment:** The 0.2-point gap is closeable with targeted additional data for `local_military_ship`, and does not reflect a fundamental architecture or methodology weakness.

---

## 🏆 Competitive Advantage

Local vs. foreign military distinction is implemented directly in the primary detector via **two separate trained classes** (`foreign_military_ship`, `local_military_ship`) rather than a secondary classification stage.

- Foreign asset identification: **strong** (93.4% recall)
- Local asset identification: **functional but weaker** (66.3% recall) — root cause documented above

> A stage-2 crop-based nationality classifier was scoped (805 military crops extracted) but deprioritised in favour of Performance Benchmark optimisation.

## 🗃️ Dataset & Data Integrity

### Sources

- SeaShips, Sea Vessels, Tanker, Speedboat, Container Ship, Fishing Boat, Cruise, and Local Military Ship datasets (Roboflow Universe, CC BY 4.0)
- ShipRSImageNet V1.1 (academic use only)
- Manually curated RMN and foreign military imagery — Wikimedia Commons, ShipSpotting.com, seaforces.org, official RMN/MOD channels

### Integrity Issues Found and Resolved

| Issue | Scope | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Train/validation leakage | 1,118 of 2,057 validation images (54%) were training-set duplicates | Fixed — deduplicated by content hash, re-split fresh |
| Watermarked / collage stock images | 713 images, concentrated in `foreign_military_ship`, `yacht`, `patrol_boat` | Accepted, documented — retained given time constraints |
| Getty Images-sourced filenames | Multiple images retain original Getty filenames | Flagged — licensing origin to confirm before public distribution |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| # | Limitation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pooled military recall (79.8%) is 0.2 pts short of the 80% benchmark | Documented |
| 2 | `local_military_ship` recall (66.3%) driven by KD Maharaja Lela data scarcity (2 unique images) | Root cause identified |
| 3 | Crowded multi-vessel scenes show partial detection loss | Root cause identified |
| 4 | 713 watermarked/collage images retained in training data | Accepted trade-off |
| 5 | Getty Images filenames present; licensing not independently confirmed | Flagged |
| 6 | Aerial coverage thinner than frontal across the dataset | Documented |
| 7 | Stage-2 nationality classifier scoped, not completed (805 crops extracted) | Deprioritised |
| 8 | Train/validation leakage (54% of original val set) — **fully corrected** | ✅ Resolved |
